# Java Project

This is the project for my CIS-175 Java II course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction

The introductory unit for Java II was mostly a fast review of the final unit of Java I. However, one new thing that was introduced to us was JUnit testing. I had previously been exposed to using JUnit in my ComS-227 class at Iowa State University, but this served as a nice review of JUnit as I hadn't used it for quite some time. Another thing we were introduced to was the lambda expression (->). I had previously heard lambda expressions but did not konw anything about them. The syntax for the lambda expression reminds me of the arrow operator in C.
